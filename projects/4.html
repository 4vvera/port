    <h2>Divisible by 3s</h2>
    <h3> a program that will ask a user how many numbers they would like to check. Then, using a for loop, prompt the user for a number, and output if that number is divisible by 3 or not. Continue doing this as many times as the user indicated. Once the loop ends, output how many numbers entered were divisible by 3 and how many were not divisible by 3.</h3>
